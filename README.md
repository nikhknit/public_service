# About Project 

This project is about exploring AIRBNB Seattle city data. We will analyse it and try to find insights out of it. 
I will try to answer following questions.
1. What are the prices for different listings in Seattle city by Airbnb ?
2. Which is the busiest and least busy month to visit Seattle ?
3. Which is the cheapest and costliest month to visit Seattle ?
4. Top 10 highly positive reviewed listings.
5. Top 10 negatively reviewed listings.
6. Building a regression model to predict the price and also identify the most influential features for price derivation.
We will also build a price prediction model at last. Lets explore it together.
